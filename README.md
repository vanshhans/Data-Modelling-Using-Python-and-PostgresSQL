# Data-Modelling-Using-Python-and-PostgresSQL
Data modeling is the process of creating a visual representation of data objects and their relationships to each other.

This is a project I made in which data modelling was performed in which postgresSQL was used as a database and python was used as the programming language.
Python's library Psycopg2 was used to communicate with the database. 
A random dataset named 'Taxi Data' was used for making tables in the database and defining relation between them.
